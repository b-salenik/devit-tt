## System requirements

- npm

<!-- system requirements (end) -->
4. Start developing:
```sh
$ npm install
$ npm run start
```
<!-- static files (start) -->
## Static files !!! IMPORTANT !!!

Place your static files inside the `shopify/assets/` directory and add the `static` keyword to their filename e.g. `myfile.static.png`. All files inside this directory are ignored by git except for files with `static` in their filename. Since this directory is also shared with files generated by webpack, it's cleaned on every consecutive build except for `static` files.
